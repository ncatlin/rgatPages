### Technologies

- [Intel Pin](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html) for generating instruction traces
- [Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid), a .NET graphics library
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) providing the GUI, via [ImGui.NET](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET)
- Force-directed graph layout based on Jared McQueens [WebGL algorithm](https://github.com/jaredmcqueen/analytics/tree/eed32e17922ef16288984e27f46717e8b7a2d602)
- [Yara](https://github.com/virustotal/yara), via the Airbus CERT [dnYara library](https://github.com/airbus-cert/dnYara)
- A woefully incomplete .NET [port](https://github.com/ncatlin/DiELibDotNet) of the [Detect-It-Easy engine](https://github.com/horsicq/DIE-engine)
- [PeNet](https://github.com/secana/PeNet) for static analysis of PE binaries
