# Design Overview

[rgat innards diagram]

### High Level Details
rgat 
* Is Written in C# for .NET 5
* Takes instruction traces generated by a custom Intel Pin tool (Written in C++) and builds them into graphs
* Uses Vulkan compute shaders to draw the graphs as static or force-directed layouts
* Has an ImGui bassed GUI - making Vulkan support a hard requirement for using the UI
* Supports 32/64 bit Windows targets
* Supports EXE's and DLL's

rgat currently supports two modes of operation
 * **Local Tracing** - The trace is generated, graphs are built and visualised on the same machine (GPU required)
 * **Remote Tracing** - The trace is generated on one machine (No GPU required) and sent in real time to a separate machine for graph building and visualisation (GPU required)
 
A third is planned for the near future
 * **Command Line Tracing** - The trace is generated and graphs are built and immediately saved to disk for analysis or sending to a machine with GPU support.


### Local Tracing Mode

[Design Diagram]

Local tracing is useful for testing and any kind of analysis of trusted programs on a standard GPU/Vulkan enabled Windows machine.


### Remote Tracing Mode

[Design Diagram]

Dynamic analysis of malicious binaries tends to be done either on a VM or another - often headless - device where local tracing mode is impractical or impossible. rgat supports a remote tracing mode where traces are generated and piped over an encrypted network connection to another rgat instance which performs graph building and visualisation. 

### Command Line (Headless) Tracing Mode

This is not yet implemented. It's unlikely to be a lot of work, but a line had to be drawn for the features to include in the 0.6 release and this didn't make the cut.
