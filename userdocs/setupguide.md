## Getting Started

### Installation

To be able to run rgat you will need the .NET 5.0 (or greater) [runtime to be installed](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet), if it isn't already.  

Everything rgat needs for basic usage is bundled in rgat.exe. It will unpack itself in the directory it is first launched in and it is safe to move this directory.

### Setup

rgat is designed to run with no configuration being required, but you may want to tweak some [settings in the settings dialog](/userdocs/ui-settingsdialog) to your liking. 

This could include:

* Entering the path of FFmpeg.exe on your system in the Files section if you want to use video capture
* Downloading signatures for automatic scanning of binary targets
* Choosing unicode character sets to load, if working with targets that use non-Western characters
* Adjusting keybinds
* Adjusting the UI theme
