## Remote Tracing

rgat provides the ability to perform tracing and visualisation on seperate devices in real time, by passing trace data to the visualiser over a network connection.

#### Security note



### Usage

rgat should be started in GUI mode as usual on the visualiser device, and in headless 'bridged' mode on the tracing device. To support different network configurations, remote tracing connection can be established in either direction.

#### Method 1: GUI -> Headless connection

#### Method 2: Headless -> GUI connection
